# Data Types Exercise

# There are three different types of data:

# NUMERIC DATA
## Integer, aka whole numbers eg. x = 5
## Float, aka decimal numbers eg. y = 2.5
## Complex Number, aka number with a 'real' and 'imaginary' componenet eg. z = 2 + 3i

# BOOLEAN DATA
## Boolean can be described as a piece of data with built
## in values that are either TRUE or FALSE. For instance:
'''
print (10>9)
'''
# The output should read 'TRUE'.

# SEQUENCE TYPE
## There are two type of built in sequence data types:
## String and List.
# String types are denoted by ', ", '"
'''
message = "This is a string declaration"
message = 'This is also a string declaration'
'''
# List types are denoted by [], with commas; a lists contents can be alter
# that is to say it is 'mutable'
'''
list1 = ['physics', chemistry', 1997, 2000]
'''

# A Tuple is alot like a list, but is denoted by paranthasis
# and it also immutable.
'''
tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)
